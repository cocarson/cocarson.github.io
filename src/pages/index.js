    <p>Hello! My name is Carson, thanks for stopping by.</p>
    <p>
      I'm a creative living in the lovely Atlanta, GA. I love building digital
      products. While I'm a front-end developer by day, I also pursue design,
      writing and photography in my free time.

      Outside of my work, you my find me at the local rock climbing gym, out
      camping, playing soccer or skiing with my family.
